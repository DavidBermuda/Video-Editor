The Debian Package videoeditor
------------------------------

 VideoEditor is a video editing application using GStreamer Editing Services
 and GStreamer.

 The goal is to enable editing multiple video clips together into a single
 composition via a simple touch interface. Add clips of various formats, trim
 them to cut out the sequences you want, reorder them as necessary, preview
 your composition and export to a new file.

 The initial version is capable of concatenation but more features will follow
 soon. Watch this space!
